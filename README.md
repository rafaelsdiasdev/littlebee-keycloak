# littlebee-keycloak

This project is a simple demo using Spring Boot with Keycloak integration.

## Running the application

Use Maven's Spring Boot plugin to start the application:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:8080`.

## Running tests

Run the test suite locally with:

```bash
mvn test
```

## Continuous Integration

A GitHub Actions workflow now builds the project and runs the tests on each push.
